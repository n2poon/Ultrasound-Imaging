# cpp 

Facilitating ultrasound imaging through A-mode pulse-echo sensing. In real life applications, a focused ultrasound pulse is sent in one direction using an array transducer into the human body. 

In this program, I created a C++ program that can import data into dynamically allocated
arrays from files, perform  sinal processing, export the results into a separate file, and release the allocated
arrays.

Main Objectives Achieved with this program
1. Created a personal function library and performed multiple file compilation
2. Handled file operations, including reading data from a file and writing results to another file
3. Created functions to perform subroutines
4. Dynamically allocated memory using pointers for data handling
5. Created and accessed 2-D arrays for processing

Files included in this file: main.cpp and Amode.cpp. These files combine to create an output.csv which can then be uploaded to an Excel spreadsheet to create a graph.
