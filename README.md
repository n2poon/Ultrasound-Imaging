# cpp 

Facilitating ultrasound imaging through A-mode pulse-echo sensing by sending a focused ultrasound pulse in one direction using an array transducer into the human body 

Created a C++ program that can import data into dynamically allocated
arrays from files, perform some signal processing, export the results into a separate file, and release the allocated
arrays.

Main Objectives Achieved with this program
1. Creatied a personal function library and performed multiple file compilation
2. Handled file operations, including reading data from a file and writing results to another file
3. Created functions to perform subroutines
4. Dynamically allocated memory using pointers for data handling
5. Created and accessed 2-D arrays for processing

Files included in this file: main.cpp and amode.cpp. These files combine to create an output.csv which can then be uploaded to an Excel spreadsheet to create a graph.
